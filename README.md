# Batch Compiler
A helpful batch script that compiles all the maps in a folder for Source 2 games.

Just run batch_map_compiler.bat in the same folder as compile_map.bat


It currently supports compiling maps for Half-Life: Alyx and s&box.

## Want to stop having to manually put in your game directory?
- Right click batch_map_compiler.bat and select edit.
- Enter in your directory here.

## Want to manually edit the compile settings?
- Right click compile_map.bat and select edit.
- Change the launch options under the comment saying "Edit this if you want to change the (Game) compile settings"
